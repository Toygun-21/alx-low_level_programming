# C File I/O Example

This is a basic example of file input and output operations in the C programming language. The provided code defines a function `read_textfile` that reads from a text file and prints its content to the standard output. The function is implemented in the `main.c` file.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the downloaded files.

## Usage

To compile and run the code, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the project directory.

2. Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):

   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -o main main.c
   ```

   This will create an executable named `main`.

3. Run the executable, providing a text file name and the number of letters to read:

   ```bash
   ./main <filename> <letters>
   ```

   Replace `<filename>` with the name of the text file you want to read from, and `<letters>` with the desired number of letters to read and print.

## Function Description

The `read_textfile` function takes two arguments:

- `filename` (const char*): The name of the text file to be read.
- `letters` (size_t): The number of letters to read and print from the file.

The function reads the specified number of letters from the file and prints them to the standard output. If any errors occur during the file operations or if the file cannot be opened, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the actual number of letters read and printed.
