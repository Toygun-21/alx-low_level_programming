# 0x0F. C - Function Pointers

## Description
This repository contains solutions to various tasks related to function pointers in the C programming language. It covers concepts such as function pointers, their usage, and practical applications.

The main goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive understanding of function pointers and their usage in C. By completing the tasks in this project, you will gain knowledge about function pointers and how they can be utilized in different scenarios.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain what function pointers are and how to use them
- Understand the purpose of function pointers and their significance in C programming
- Identify the data held by a function pointer and where it points in virtual memory

## Project Tasks
The project consists of several tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of function pointers. The tasks are as follows:

### 0. What's my name
Write a function that prints a name using function pointers.

### 1. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done
Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.

### 2. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities
Write a function that searches for an integer in an array using function pointers.

### 3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at
Write a program that performs simple arithmetic operations using function pointers.

### 4. Most hackers are young because young people tend to be adaptable. As long as you remain adaptable, you can always be a good hacker
Write a program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder, is mandatory
- Code should use the Betty style and will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- Use of global variables is not allowed
- No more than 5 functions are allowed per file
- Only the following C standard library functions are allowed: `malloc`, `free`, and `exit`
- Use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc., is forbidden
- Use of `_putchar` is allowed
- The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in a header file named `function_pointers.h`
- Header files should be include guarded

## Usage
- Clone the repository using the following command:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/your_username/alx-low_level_programming.git
  ```

- Navigate to the project directory:

  ```
  cd alx-low_level_programming/0x0F-function_pointers
  ```

- Compile the C files using the provided makefile:

  ```
  make
  ```

- Run the compiled programs:

  ```
  ./program_name
  ```
